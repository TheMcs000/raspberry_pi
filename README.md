In this repository you can find the code on my raspberry pi.  
Currently the following "subprograms" are running:

# LED API
Using node and the NPM Package magic-home you can request effects to the API

# Home assistant
Using python the home assistant can detect people going in / out my room using light barriers.  
Furthermore it will be able to talk to me :)
